# BeachScanAI - Ibdaa Competition Project

## Overview
BeachScanAI is an innovative AI-powered application designed to revolutionize beach cleanliness monitoring. By leveraging advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies, our solution automatically analyzes beach images to detect and quantify waste, providing real-time insights into environmental health.

## The Problem
Beaches worldwide face increasing pollution challenges, with plastic waste and debris impacting marine ecosystems and tourism. Traditional monitoring methods are time-consuming, costly, and often inaccurate. BeachScanAI addresses this critical need with an automated, scalable solution.

## Our Solution
Our application allows users to upload beach photos or provide image URLs, and instantly receives detailed analysis including:
- Detection of waste items with high accuracy
- Cleanliness scoring on a scale from Clean to Dirty
- Visual bounding boxes highlighting detected waste
- Comprehensive summary reports for multiple images

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Utilizes state-of-the-art Roboflow models for precise waste identification
- **Multi-Image Processing**: Handles batch uploads for efficient large-scale monitoring
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Provides instant results with customizable confidence thresholds
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive web application accessible from any device
- **Environmental Impact**: Supports conservation efforts by enabling data-driven cleanup strategies

## Innovation & Impact
BeachScanAI represents a breakthrough in environmental monitoring technology, combining artificial intelligence with practical application to create measurable positive change. By making beach assessment fast, accurate, and accessible, we empower communities, governments, and organizations to take proactive steps in protecting our coastal environments.

## Vision
To become the global standard for automated beach cleanliness assessment, contributing to cleaner oceans and sustainable tourism through technology-driven environmental stewardship.
